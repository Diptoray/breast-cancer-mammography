# malignant-mammography

Summary : This project aims to create a deep learning model using Tensorflow and Keras to predict whether a breast tumour is benign or malignant based on patients' personal data as well as data about the mammographic mass(the tumour) itself.
10-fold cross validation has been used to compute the results, with accuracy being the metric. The best result obtained was an accuracy of 80.12% , where an accuracy of 80% was previously determined to be a good result by experts.
